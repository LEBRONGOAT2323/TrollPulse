# TrollPulse
This is a retro, glitchy CRT-style loading screen built to troll. It simulates a vintage terminal with flickering visuals and glitch effects that never ends.

Features

Progress Bar: Shows loading progress with a realistic “phosphor” glow that never ends.

Percent Display: Updates alongside the progress bar.

Random Messages: Fun and quirky loading messages appear during progress.

Glitch Effects: Jitter, burn-in, neverending loading, and screen drop effects increase as loading nears completion.

Warning Text: The system integrity warning occasionally corrupts with random characters for a realistic glitch effect.

Fully Visual: No user interaction required—just watch the retro loading animation.
